# Group Project: Bigfoot Sightings Analysis
1. Demonstrate mastery of data science tools (python, data frames, visualizations)
2. Communicate results to a general audience
## Description
Your team will use the tools learned in MA705 to conduct and present a descriptive statis- tics analysis of Bigfoot records. Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is an ape-like creature purported to inhabit the forests of North America. Supposed evidence of Bigfoot, including sightings, photographs, footprints, etc, have been presented throughout the 20th century.

While the credibility of such evidence may certainly be questioned, the influence of the Bigfoot on US culture and perhaps reflection of it cannot be. What does an analysis of the Bigfoot sightings data set reveal? Your teamâ€™s analysis will be presented in a Jupyter notebook and include several visualizations.


# Steps to install and run this notebook

## Prerequisite:
* Python@3.10 or more
* GeoPandas@0.10.2 or more

## Additional data folders
a) state_geo folder (shared on previous classes) consisting of state info must be inside src/ folder as "src/state_geo/*.shp".
b) county_geo folder as this project dependency should be inside src/ folder as "src/count_geo/*.shp"
c) county.csv inside src/ folder.
d) bigfoot.csv data inside src/ folder

## Installation:
a) MAC:
   - Open terminal (command+space -> terminal)
   - Go to the unzipped folder
   - invoke "./init.sh"

   if homebrew is installed and python is of lower version, init will try to install python3.10.
   You will then need to EXIT the terminal window (close it) and spin up a new window, for the .zshrc file to refresh the path.

b) Linux and Windows environment will require python3.10 to be installed outside the script.


## What init.sh script does.
   - Once you have python@3.10, it will expect annaconda to be also there already.
   - The script will then create a virtual environment on the local folder and install all its depedencies (some needs complex installation and certain order for geopandas to install correctly). Mainly, gdal, blas, numpy and scikit are the prerequisites thatis operating system dependent.
   - It will subsequently download required nlp model (~777mb) for smoother experience within the notebook. 

   - wait for few seconds after the browser comes up, jupyter takes a while to bring up the notebook.

## Troubleshooting:
   - in case of any difficulty, please contact any of the following team members:

     a) Soubhik @ schakraborty@falcon.bentley.edu
     b) Yousuf  @ maziz@falcon.bentley.edu
